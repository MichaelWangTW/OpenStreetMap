# OpenStreetMap

For this web mapping application, we will focus on four major parts of functions, namely, map rastering, finding shortest route between two
user-identified locations, autocomplete searching, and performing step-by-step navigation.
mainly focus on back-end building

Funtions | Detailed Explanation
--------------- | ---------------
Map Rastering | Given coordinates of a rectangular region of the world and the size of the web browser window, provide images of the appropriate resolution that cover that region.
Routing | Given a start and destination latitude and longitude, provide street directions between those points.
Autocomplete | Given a string, find all locations that match that string.
Turn-by-turn Navigation | Augment the routing from Part II to include written driving directions
